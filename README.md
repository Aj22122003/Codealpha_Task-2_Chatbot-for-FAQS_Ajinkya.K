# 🤖 Codealpha Task 2: Chatbot for FAQs ❓

**👋 Welcome to the Chatbot for FAQs project!**

This repository contains the code for a chatbot designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs). Built using Python, this project demonstrates how to create an interactive tool to provide quick and helpful responses to common queries. 💬

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the chatbot. 🐍

**⚙️ Getting Started**

To run the FAQ chatbot:

1.  **Clone the repository:** 💻
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AJ22122003/Codealpha_Task_2-Chatbot-for-FAQs_Ajinkya.K.git](https://github.com/AJ22122003/Codealpha_Task_2-Chatbot-for-FAQs_Ajinkya.K.git)
    cd Codealpha_Task_2-Chatbot-for-FAQs_Ajinkya.K
    ```

2.  **Ensure necessary libraries are installed:** While not explicitly listed, this project likely uses standard Python libraries. If you encounter any import errors, install the required packages using pip. For example:
    ```bash
    pip install nltk  # If Natural Language Toolkit is used
    # Add other necessary libraries as needed
    ```

3.  **Run the chatbot script:** 🚀
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

4.  **Interact with the chatbot:** Once the script is running, you should be able to type in questions and receive answers based on the FAQ data. 🤔

**💾 FAQ Data**

The `faq_data` file likely contains the questions and their corresponding answers that the chatbot uses. The format of this file could be plain text, CSV, JSON, or another structured format. Examine this file to understand the knowledge base of the chatbot. 🧐

**🖼️ Output Image**

The `output2.png` file might contain a screenshot or visualization of the chatbot in action or some relevant output from the preprocessing steps. Take a look at this image to get a visual understanding of the project. 👀

**🧹 Preprocessing**

The `preprocess.py` script might be responsible for preparing the FAQ data before it's used by the chatbot. This could involve tasks like cleaning text, tokenization, or creating embeddings. Examine this script to understand any data preparation steps involved. ⚙️

**🤝 Contributions**

[Optional: If you'd like others to contribute, add guidelines here on how they can do so (e.g., reporting issues, suggesting new FAQs, submitting pull requests).]
